// Practice exercise 1.1

// 1. Open the browser console, type 4 + 10, and press Enter. What do you see as
// the response?

14

// 2. Use the console.log() syntax, placing a value within the rounded brackets.
// Try entering your name with quotes around it (this is to indicate the fact that
// it's a text stringâ€”we'll get to this in the next chapter).


console.log("samra khan");

// Practice exercise 1.2
// JavaScript in an HTML page:

// 1. Open your code editor and create an HTML file.

// 2. Within your HTML file, set up the HTML tags, doctype, HTML, head, and
// body, and then proceed and add the script tags.

// 3. Place some JavaScript code within the script tags. You can use console.
// log("hello world!")

// Practice exercise 1.3
// Linking to a JS JavaScript file:

// 1. Create a separate file called app with the extension .js.

// 2. Within the .js file, add some JavaScript code.

// app.js

console.log("working on app js");


// 3. Link to the separate .js file within the HTML file you created in Practice
// exercise 1.2.

// 4. Open the HTML file within your browser and check to see whether the
// JavaScript code ran properly.




// Practice exercise 1.4
// Adding comments:

//  1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value.
//  Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line:
// let a = 10;

let a = 10;


// 2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of
//  10. 




// 3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this
// will do.
// Getting Started with JavaScript
// [ 14 ]

console.log(a); // Print the value of 'a'

// 4. At the end of your JavaScript code, use a multiple-line comment. In a real
// production script, you might use this space to add a brief outline of the
// purpose of the file

// Self-check quiz

// 1. What is the HTML syntax to add an external JavaScript file?

//    To add an external JavaScript file to an HTML document, you use the `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute. Here's the syntax:

//    ```html
//    <script src="external.js"></script>
//    ```

//    Replace `"external.js"` with the actual path to your JavaScript file.

// 2. **Can you run JavaScript in a file with a JS extension in your browser?**

//    No, you cannot directly run a JavaScript file (with a `.js` extension) in a web browser like you do with HTML files.
//     JavaScript files are meant to be included in HTML files using the `<script>` tag.  You run JavaScript code by including it within an HTML file and then opening that HTML file in
//      a web browser.
  

// 3. **How do you write a multiple-line comment in JavaScript?**

//    You can write a multiple-line comment in JavaScript using `/*` to begin the comment block and `*/` to end it. Here's an example:

//    ```javascript
//    /*
//       This is a multiple-line comment.
//       It can span multiple lines.
//    */
//    ```

// 4. What is the best way to remove a line of code from running that you might want to keep as you debug?

//    The best way to temporarily disable a line of code from running while debugging is to comment it out. 
//    You can use `//` to comment out a single line or `/* */` to comment out multiple lines. 

//    Single-line comment:

//    ```javascript
//    // This line of code won't run
//    ```

//    Multiple-line comment:

//    ```javascript
//    /*
//       This block of code won't run.
//       You can comment out multiple lines.
//    */
//    ```
